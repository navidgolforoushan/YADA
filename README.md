# YADA (Yet Another Dating App)
This is a demo dating application build on C#/React.
I started build this application in my spare time. goal is building it with some bad practices and just mock to make sure it is working. then applying best-practices and making it awsome. goal is building back-end based on .net technologies mix of REST,OData and GraphQl. front-end will build by react and ionic. then I will add IdentityServer for using it as SSO service and break back-end to multiple services and each using different databse (both SQL and NoSQL) technologies and backend technologies which will include NodeJs,C#,Java,Payton,C++ and we will containerize this services! so much fun.
We will add cicd pipeline based on jenkins and azure and we will add unit-test to our code! lots of fun!.
Waite! Im not done... I will going to use ML.net, tenserflow and Cloud-Based MachineLearning model to find a perfect match that's even more fun! :D
My goal is builing tutorial contents based on this project and you can see work style of a developer in a agile team. and learn from real-life scenarios.
